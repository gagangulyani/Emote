Emote is a modern emoji picker for Linux ðŸš€. Written in GTK3, Emote is lightweight and stays out of your way.

Launch the emoji picker with the configurable keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+E` and select one or more emojis to have them be automatically pasted into your currently focussed app.

Note - Emote under Wayland cannot automatically paste the emoji into other apps and also requires manual registering of a global keyboard shortcut - [Hotkey In Wayland](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/Emote/wiki/Hotkey-In-Wayland). This is due to intentional restrictions in the design of Wayland itself.
